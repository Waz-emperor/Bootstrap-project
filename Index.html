                    <h5 class="card-title">Companions</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The game features a passive form of crafting, known as Crew Skills, in which a player's companions carry out gathering and crafting tasks asynchronously to the player's adventures out in the world. Each class gets five companions via their storyline. The player can assign up to five companions to perform up to 3 various skills. Crafting skills allow the player's companions to create items, and the player can reverse engineer many items to possibly learn to make a better version. The item is destroyed in the process, but the player gets some of the materials back. Gathering skills allow the player or their companions to gather resources out in the world. Mission skills allow the player's companions to perform acts on the player's behalf, gaining the player Light or Darkside influence and other rewards, such as medical items or companion gifts.[36]

During E3 2011, a video was shown with gameplay footage of the Bounty Hunter, along with a Jawa companion named Blizz. The developers stated during the chat that only the Bounty Hunter would be able to get Blizz and that other classes would have unique companions as well, including some companions that are force users. It was also shown that companions would have a similar character screen as the players and can have gear just like a player character.

BioWare announced same-sex romance options with companions or other NPCs before release.[37] The options were implemented for some non-companions in Rise of the Hutt Cartel, and expanded with Shadow of Revan. Options for some new companions were implemented in Knights of the Fallen Empire, and expanded for some new and original companions with Knights of the Eternal Empire up to marriage.

During patch 1.5, HK-51 was added for all classes on both Empire and Republic factions. He was the first companion added to every classes, and can be obtained through a questline. He is an assassin droid based on the popular HK-47 from the original Knights of the Old Republic series.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The Old Republic is BioWare's first entry into the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) market,[15] and is the second Star Wars MMORPG after Star Wars Galaxies, which was shut down in December 2011,[44] the same month SWTOR was released. The development saw the entirety of BioWare Austin working on the game.[45] BioWare had long been interested in working on a MMORPG, but waited until they had "the right partners, the right team, and the right I.P."[17] A major focus in the game is on developing characters' individual stories[15] and, in October 2008, BioWare considered this game to have more story content than all of their other games combined.[17] The writing team worked on the project longer than any of the game's other development teams.[33] An October 2008 preview noted some of the 12 full-time writers had been working on The Old Republic for more than two years at that point.[17] Although BioWare has not disclosed development costs, industry leaders and financial analysts have estimated it to be between $150 million and $200 million or more, making it, at the time, the most expensive video game made,[46][47] though if marketing costs are included, it is eclipsed by Grand Theft Auto V, with an estimated cost of $265 million.[48] The game had 1 million subscribers within three days of its launch, making it the world's "fastest-growing MMO ever".[10][11] However, in the following months the game lost a fair share of its subscriptions, but has remained profitable.[12] The game has since adopted the hybrid free-to-play business model with remaining subscription option.[13] It is estimated that the game made $139 million in additional revenues, in addition to the subscription income, in 2013.[49]

The game's first cinematic trailer, "Deceived", was shown at the Electronic Arts 2009 E3 Press Conference on June 1, 2009.[50] A public live demo was shown for the first time at the Gamescom. On September 29, 2009, BioWare announced that they would be accepting applications for testers from the game community. Within minutes, the official website was down due to traffic, and BioWare announced shortly after that the site was being changed in order to accommodate the increase in visitors. A second cinematic trailer, "Hope", was released on June 14, 2010, that depicts another battle that happened before the game, the Battle of Alderaan. On June 6, a new trailer "Return" was released at E3 2011 depicting the initial Sith invasion force as it retakes its home world of Korriban. Game testing was officially announced to be underway on July 9, 2010, for testers from North American territories.

Although released in most regions of the world, EA have said Australasia will be getting the game at a later date.[51] The reason behind this is to hold back digital and boxed copies for a smooth launch so to avoid any problems encountered during launch.[52] However, BioWare revealed that the game would not be region or IP blocked, allowing players to purchase the game from other regions.[53] Additionally, BioWare allowed Australian and New Zealand players to take part in the beta stages of the game. BioWare community manager Allison Berryman said "Data from this test will be used to inform decisions about the launch of the game in Oceanic regions", however, she was unable to provide any information in regards to the game's launch in those regions.[54]

On October 11, 2011, BioWare announced that Star Wars: The Old Republic would be released globally on December 20, 2011.[8] However, this 'global' launch only included North America and a part of Europe, as the launch date had delayed for the Asia and Oceanic regions.[55] On December 21, 2011, BioWare announced that an Australian and New Zealand release date had been set for March 1, 2012.

Early access to the game was granted one week before release, on December 13, 2011, for those who had pre-ordered the game online; access opened in "waves" based on pre-order date.[9]

On January 18, 2012, the first content patch (1.1) was released, adding a new Flashpoint and adding four bosses to an existing Operation. Patch (1.2) was released on April 12, 2012. The update included the new Legacy system, a new Flashpoint, Operation, a PVP Warzone, as well as improved character textures and advanced options such as user interface customization. Guild banks and player character pets are also introduced. A Weekend Pass Free Trial was made available for new players but has since closed. Patch 1.3 was released in June 2012. The game update featured a New Group Finder, the ability to augment every item, and adaptable social gear. In addition, players will be able to request that their characters are able to transfer to other servers. Subsequent patches have introduced a 'Cartel Market' where players can purchase virtual currency to spend on cosmetic items in-game. These items include armour sets, lightsaber colour crystals, mounts, pets and character-perk unlocks.

In January 2012, Star Wars: The Old Republic was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the "Largest Entertainment Voice Over Project Ever", with over 200,000 lines of recorded dialogue.[56] This feat is recorded in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition book. On April 26, 2012, BioWare announced that the game was available in the Middle East and remaining European countries who were excluded from the original launch.[57]</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Each faction contains different classes, each with a distinct backstory and a branching storyline affected by players' moral choices.[17] Classes are exclusive to one faction or the other. However, the classes of one faction mirror the classes of the other (for example, Jedi Knight and Sith Warrior).[32] Eight classes exist: the Bounty Hunter, Sith Warrior, Imperial Agent, and Sith Inquisitor for the Sith Empire; and the Trooper, Smuggler, Jedi Knight, and Jedi Consular for the Galactic Republic. Although each class has a distinct storyline, they are integrated with the game's overall arc.[33]

Each class may also choose from two advanced classes, resulting in a total of 8 advanced classes per faction. Advanced classes share the same storyline as their base class. Lightsaber and blaster colors are not faction or class restricted, but some are restricted based on level and/or Lightside or Darkside alignment. For example, some lightsabers can only be bought if Light or Darkside aligned.</p>
